DATABASES
=========

Relational Database System (RDBMS)

•	Designed using JAVA and its external libraries like JSqlParser and JDBM2.
•	Implemented a simple SQL query evaluator with support for Select, Project, Join, Union, and Aggregate operations.The 
  code was expected to evaluate the SELECT statements on provided data, and produce output in a standardized form. 
•	Cost optimizations such as external sorting and Sort-merge joins were implemented to reduce the query evaluation time.
•	Hash and Tree Indexes were created using JDBM2 to further reduce the scanning time on the given relations.
•	Implemented the use of INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE statements. A file containing multiple operations was presented to the parser,
  and was expected to fully evaluate all queries and database updates included in it.
